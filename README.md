# Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning algorithms

This notebook has as the main goal classify the presence or absence of heart disease in the patient based on some factors. Some ML algorithms were used for this purpose.  

Mainly topics that are involved in this notebook are:
* Exploratory analysis
* Preprocessing data
* Model training
* Modelo evaluation
* Hyperparameter tunning (k-fold Cross Validation)
* Modelo Comparision

The dataset is popular on Kaggle, and it is available at https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci. 

The dataset is relatively easy to work with since it does not have missing data and few features and observations. 

The best models under the 5-fold cross validation were


| Model               |  Accuracy  |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
|  Logistic Regression |   85.15% |
|  SVM (linear kernel) |  85.99%  |
| Random Forest | 84.75 %  |
